Author: Stephen Thompson

scikit-surgery-sphere-fitting is part of the `SciKit-Surgery`_ software project, developed at the `Wellcome EPSRC Centre for Interventional and Surgical Sciences`_, part of `University College London (UCL)`_.

scikit-surgery-sphere-fitting supports Python 3.6.

scikit-surgery-sphere-fitting fits a sphere to a set of 3D points. It includes a user interface that
will read data from a vtk polydata file create an output polydata file showing the fitted sphere.
Example usage:

::

    python sksurgeryspherefitting.py polydata_in.vtp --output polydatata_out.vtp --config conf.json

It was created in part to provide a simple demonstration of algorithm development as part of a
program of SNAPPY Tutorials, but also provides a useful service should you want to fit a sphere
to some data.
